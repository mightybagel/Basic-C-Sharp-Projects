### Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
I have finished a small project coded with C# and .NET framework.
#### Project: Car Insurance
- In this project, I used a ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework to build a Database-First approached database. The program allows user to enter his/her personal information such as name, driving records (DUI, speeding tickets), email address to get insurance quotes which were generated based on business logic. There is an admin view that allows staff to view all the issued quotes.
